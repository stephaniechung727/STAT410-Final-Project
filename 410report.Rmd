# Introduction

This study aims to expand on the understanding of high school adolescentsâ€™ gaming behaviour and its impact on academic performance. Specifically, the cross-sectional study had four main aims. Our first aim was to examine whether gamer students who played videogames at different platforms and times scored higher than students who did not play any video games at all. Our second aim was to determine if there is a decline in gamer students grades from playing videogames for exceptionally long hours. Our third aim was to examine whether the results were consistent across all ages. Our final aim was to compare the grades of the genders (man and woman) for both categories of gamers and non-gamers.

# Methods

In early March 2021, 56 adolescents from Frank Hurt Secondary and 122 adolescents from David Thompson Secondary participated in the cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey study (x% man). The students were from diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, with ages ranging from 13 to 18 (Report mean age and sd of age). The response rate was close to perfect due to the design format where the selected teachers conducted the survey during class-time and all the students present participated.
